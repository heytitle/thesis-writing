Importantly, I would like to give special thanks to my family for always supporting me in every aspect as well as encouraging me to develop and pursue my own interests.
\\

\noindent
I would like to say thank you to my all friends for all discussions we had, especially EIT Data Science fellows including Akash Singh, Zitong Lian, Pham Duy and Shashank Srivastava who gave me detailed feedback of the first draft of this thesis. I would also like to thank EIT Master School, TU/e, and TUB staffs who have been organizing this wonderful master study program.

I would also like to acknowledge William Vanmoerkerke for lending me a powerful laptop throughout my study. None of my work, including assignments and this thesis, would have been achieved without this laptop.  Lastly, I would like to credit Amazon AWS for offering the educational credits, Github for the student developer pack and Sketch for the student discount. These resources were used in this thesis.
