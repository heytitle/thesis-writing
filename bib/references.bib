  abstract = {Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts, allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for other applications.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear methods such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the gold standard for various challenging machine learning problems such as image recognition. Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.},

  abstract = {As handheld video cameras are now commonplace and available in every
smartphone, images and videos can be recorded almost everywhere at anytime.
However, taking a quick shot frequently yields a blurry result due to unwanted
camera shake during recording or moving objects in the scene. Removing these
artifacts from the blurry recordings is a highly ill-posed problem as neither
the sharp image nor the motion blur kernel is known. Propagating information
between multiple consecutive blurry observations can help restore the desired
sharp image or video. Solutions for blind deconvolution based on neural
networks rely on a massive amount of ground-truth data which is hard to
acquire. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to produce a
significant amount of realistic training data and introduce a novel recurrent
network architecture to deblur frames taking temporal information into account,
which can efficiently handle arbitrary spatial and temporal input sizes. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach in a comprehensive comparison on a

  abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques.

We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest.

In this paper, we focus on recently proposed weight initialization with identity matrix for the recurrent weights in a RNN. This initialization is specifically proposed for hidden nodes with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) non linearity. We offer a simple dynamical systems perspective on weight initialization process, which allows us to propose a modified weight initialization strategy. We show that this initialization technique leads to successfully training RNNs composed of ReLUs.

This is because the relationship between image features (even semantic ones extracted by existing tools, viz., faces, objects, and so on) and users' likes is non-linear, influenced by several subtle factors. This paper presents a deep bi-modal knowledge representation of images based on their visual content and associated tags (text). A mapping step between the different levels of visual and textual representations allows for the transfer of semantic knowledge between the two modalities. Feature selection is applied before learning deep representation to identify the important features for a user to like an image. The proposed representation is shown to be effective in discriminating users based on images they like and also in recommending images that a given user likes, outperforming the state-of-the-art feature representations by 15 \%-20\%. Beyond this test-set performance, an attempt is made to qualitatively understand the representations learned by the deep architecture used to model user likes.},

  title = {Understanding {{Representations Learned}} in {{Deep Architectures}}},
  abstract = {Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, especially with vision datasets. Deep learning algorithms are based on learning several levels of representation of the input. Beyond test-set performance, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures, focused on those learned representations. One of the goals of our research is to improve tools for finding good qualitative interpretations of high level features learned by such models. We also seek to gain insight into the invariances learned by deep networks. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques for finding such interpretations. We applied our techniques on Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that consistent filter-like interpretation is possible and simple to accomplish at the unit level. The tools developed make it possible to analyze deep models in more depth and accomplish the tracing of invariance manifolds for each of the hidden units. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work.},

  abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

While this approach can be applied directly to generalized linear mappings, product type non-linearities are not covered. This paper proposes an approach to extend layer-wise relevance propagation to neural networks with local renormalization layers, which is a very common product-type non-linearity in convolutional neural networks. We evaluate the proposed method for local renormalization layers on the CIFAR-10, Imagenet and MIT Places datasets.},

We identify two fundamental axioms---Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

In the present work, we extend the usage of LRP to recurrent neural networks. We propose a specific propagation rule applicable to multiplicative connections as they arise in recurrent network architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply our technique to a word-based bi-directional LSTM model on a five-class sentiment prediction task, and evaluate the resulting LRP relevances both qualitatively and quantitatively, obtaining better results than a gradient-based related method which was used in previous work.},
